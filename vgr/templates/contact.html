	 "My name is Hayley Christianson, and I will be attending UIC for computer science. A fun fact about me: I have a blood disorder called beta thalassemia which stops iron from entering my bloodstream via the beta globin. I am very sleepy a lot and can get sick a lot worse than most people. This is what drove me to stay indoors more often and then I discovered Computer science would be a great career for me!"
